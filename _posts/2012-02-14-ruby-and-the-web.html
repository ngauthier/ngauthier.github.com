<p>Here's a talk I gave at Bmore on Rails (Baltimore's Rails user group). I talk about MVC vs Model 2 and how they apply to Rails. I talk about Frameworks vs Libraries and White Box vs Black box. Also I talk about a theoretical framework I experimented with to try to implement a more object oriented system for dealing with the web in Ruby (based on Rack).</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
